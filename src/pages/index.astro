			<p>
				Hi! I'm Mayu, a 19 year old collective of trans girls interested in
				programming, drawing, urbanism and lots of other stuff.
			</p>

			<p>
				I tinker with pretty much anything, but primarily web development and
				mobile applications. Self-hosting is also one of my most recent objects of
				interest ^^!
			</p>

			<p>
				One way or another, my favorite programming languages are TypeScript and
				Go. I am also slowly learning Rust and Flutter/Dart.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can talk to me in: English (proficient), Polish (native), Norwegian
				(basic), Dutch (barely basic)
			</p>
